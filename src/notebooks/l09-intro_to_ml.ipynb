    "# Typical Machine Learning Project Life Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, a Machine Learning project is broken down into the following steps:\n",
    "1. Data collection: from different sources could be internal and/or external to satisfy the business requirements/problems. Data could be in any format. CSV, XML.JSON, etc., here Big Data is playing a vital role to make sure the right data is in the expected format and structure.\n",
    "1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): gather insights from the dataset. Identify the necessary feature engineering steps to be done in the next step.\n",
    "1. Data preparation: The data is prepared for the ML task. This preparation involves data cleaning, where you split the data into training, validation, and test sets (70-10-20 or 70-15-15 are common ratios). You also apply data transformations and feature engineering to the model that solves the target task. The output of this step are the data splits in the prepared format.\n",
    "1. Model training: The data scientist implements different algorithms with the prepared data to train various ML models. In addition, you subject the implemented algorithms to hyperparameter tuning to get the best performing ML model. The output of this step is a trained model.\n",
    "1. Model evaluation: The model is evaluated on a holdout test set to evaluate the model quality. Evaluate the model against a set of metrics like: AUC, Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, RMSE, R2, etc.\n",
    "1. Model validation: The model is confirmed to be adequate for deployment—that its predictive performance is better than a certain baseline.\n",
    "1. Deployment: means the integration of the finalized model into a production environment and getting results to make business decisions.\n",
    "1. Monitoring: The model predictive performance is monitored to potentially invoke a new iteration in the ML process.\n",
